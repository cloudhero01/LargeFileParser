### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for a project that reflects an understanding of data structures and how to achieve small data complexity in the implementation.

More specifically, this program randomly generates statistics for a maximum of 100 baseball players, based on the integer entered at runtime and obtains the best statistic from all players.  
This integer will add a line of player statistic (a player who was up to bat and the outcome).

NOTE:  This program is capable of reading through billions of lines, but be aware something like that will take about 2 hours.
